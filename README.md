### I'm Making Podcasts

I'm a technology geek podcaster with an EVER so slight Apple bias. Along with my flagship podcast the NosillaCast and my conversation podcast Chit Chat across the Pond Lite, I also do a podcast with <a href="https://bbusschots.github.io">Bart Busschots</a> called Programming by Stealth. He's teaching the audience to program in an audio podcast with amazing tutorial shownotes at <a href="https://pbs.bartificer.net">pbs.bartificer.net</a>.
  
The result of that instruction is my little corner of GitHub.  Hope you enjoy and get value out of the work I do here.

My repos are at https://github.com/podfeet
